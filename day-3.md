## ðŸ“± Day 3

Today, we are looking at data types that group data together:
- Arrays
- Dictionaries
- Sets

### How to store ordered data in arrays

It's very common to want to have lots of data in a single place, in Swift, we do this grouping using an `array`. Arrays are their own data type just like a `string`. But reather than hold just one string, they can hold anywhere from 0 strings to millions of strings. In Swift, arrays automatically adapt to hold as many as you need, unlike a language like `C`.

Arrays in Swift are also in order that you add them. Here is a couple of examples of arrays:
```
var beatles = ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo"]
let numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
```

When reading data out of an array, we ask for the value at a specific location inside of the array starting from 0 at the first location. for example:
```
print(beatles[0])
// Output = John
```

With swift, as long as your array is of type `variable` and not `constant`, then you can add to it using the `.append` command. Like this:
```
beatles.append("Adrian")
```

Your arrays data must match. You cannot have an array with integers and strings together. To tell Swift what type the array is, you can do the following to create an empty array:
```
var scores = Array<Int>()
```
For strings, you do:
```
var scores = Array<String>()
```

Because strings are so common in Swift, there is a shorhand for creating them. To recreate the examples about, it would look like this:
```
var scores = [Int]()
var scores = [Strings]()
```

You can provide some initial data, if it is available and Swift will automatically choose the type for you. Like this:
```
var albums = ["Folklore"]
```

With Swift, you can also count the amount of items that are in an array by doing `.count` like this:
```
print(albums.count)
```

You can also remove items from an array by doing `.remove(at: )` like this:
```
characters.remove(at: 2)
```

Or you can remove all the data from the array using the `.removeAll()` function.
```
characters.removeAll()
```

You can search an array for a particular item by using the `.contains()` command, like this:
```
print(bondMovies.contains("Frozen"))
```

You can sort an array in ascending alphabetically by doing `.sorted()` like this:
```
print(cities.sorted())
```
Or you can do decending alphabetically by doing `.reversed()` like this:
```
print(presidents.reversed())
```

### How to store and find data in dictionaries

Arrays are a great way to store data in a ordered basis and when you have duplicate data. But it can be dangerous for your app to store important data in an array because the order of the array can change if you delete a peice of data. This makes it impossible to know where your data is in the array at all times. For example, say you had these 5 strings in an array:
```
var workDays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
```

At the moment, your program (assuming you have set it up correctly), knows that Monday is in the `[0]` possition of the array, Tuesday is in the `[1]` position and so on.

But what happens if you delete `Monday` for example? Well, everything will shift down a place. The array will now look like something like this:
```
workDays = ["Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]
```

Now, you would need to adjust your code to call the right positions.

Luckily, there is another data structure you can use instead called `dictionaries`. Dictionaries are a great way to store information using a `key` and `value`. For example, let's look at how we could store someones name, job, and location:
```
let employee2 = [
  "name": "Taylor"
  "job": "Singer"
  "location": "Nashville"
]
```

As you can see, on the left are the `keys` and on the right, are the `values` of those keys. The way that we call to data here is by calling to the keys and also adding a default value if there is no data at that location. it looks like this:
```
print(employee2["name", default: "Unknown"])
```

As you can see, this collects the name (if there is one saved in the dictionary) and prints the value. If there is no data under `name`, then the code will print `"Unknown"`.

You can also store booleans in a dictionary too, like this:
```
let hasGraduated = [
  "Eric": false,
  "Meave": true,
  "Otis": false,
]
```

You can also use integers as keys like this:
```
let olympics = [
  2012: "London",
  2016: "Rio de Janeiro",
  2021: "Tokyo"
]
```

You can create an empty dictionary by doing:
```
var heights = [String: Int]()
```

Then to add to the dictionary later, you can do:
```
heights["Yao Ming"] = 229
```

`.count` and `.removeAll()` still work with dictionaries.

### How to use sets and fast data lookup

The third method for storing data is called a `set`.
